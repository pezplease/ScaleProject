This is a simple bluetooth low energy scale running on a TTGO ESP32 1.14 inch display board with an hx711 and load cell. It currently can properly advertise the bluetooth service, but currently there are problems with reading the data from the client device. Tare currently is the left button (gpio pin 0). 

The only thing left for this project is to let the bluetooth client tare the scale remotely and troubleshoot the problems with data transfer.  

TTGO esp32 plus display isa also listed as Hiletgo display on amazon. Link to github: https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO-T-Display/tree/master
